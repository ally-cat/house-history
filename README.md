### Electricity went out

Electricity went out in three separate areas of the house:

- Guest bedroom
- Bathroom
- Hallway light switch

We had someone from xxx come by and look at it. It turns out that nothing major happened.

The wiring for the aforementioned locations is located within the light. Something came loose and caused the lighting for those three areas to go out. The electrician just had to tweak some of the wires that were in some wire nuts.

### Old air conditioner disconnect

The air conditioner seemingly stopped working after installing a smart thermostat. It turned out that the disconnect (big ass switch) next to the the air conditioner was just old and wasn't connecting the leads to the circuit in the switch. We jumped the leads for a day and then had the air conditioner servicer come out and fix the disconnect.

### Update the thermostat

Added Ecobee thermostat to the house.
